# React Router Dom Unexpected Route Matching Bug

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug related to unexpected route matching in React Router Dom v6.  The problem involves a scenario where routes are not matched as expected, either matching incorrectly or failing to match altogether.  The solution provides a corrected approach to ensure proper route handling.

## Bug Description

The original `App.js` contains a common routing setup. However, under certain conditions (e.g., specific navigation or URL changes), the routing might behave unexpectedly.  This may manifest as incorrect components rendering, unintended redirects, or routes failing to be matched correctly. This is often difficult to debug because it might only happen under specific circumstances.

## Solution

The `AppSolution.js` file shows the corrected routing configuration. The solution might involve careful examination of the route paths, ensuring correct component placement, or addressing conflicts with other parts of the application.
